## Introduction

This program models an Airport simulation system where plans arrive, get serviced, and exit the system. It utilizes a DEQ2 data structure to manage the queue and simulate job arrivals and departures.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

Upon running the program, it will simulate plan arrivals, service times, and calculate average wait times.

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- C++ Standard Library

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several files:

1. `main.cpp`: Contains the main simulation logic.
2. ``DEQ2.h` and `DEQ2.cpp`: Implement the DEQ2 data structure.
3. `node.h` and `node.cpp`: Define and implement the Node class used in the DEQ2.
